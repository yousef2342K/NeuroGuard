## Executive Summary

NeuroGuard is a cutting-edge, AI-powered wearable health monitoring system engineered as a lightweight handband or headband. It leverages integrated sensors to continuously track vital signs, neural signals (EEG/EMG), and movements, enabling the prediction and detection of epilepsy seizures 1-5 minutes in advance. Alerts are delivered in real-time via mobile app notifications, cloud dashboards, on-device audio/vibration alarms, or automated emergency SMS/calls—ensuring proactive intervention to mitigate risks of injury or SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy).

Designed for scalability, reliability, and regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR), NeuroGuard follows a hybrid edge-cloud architecture. It supports seamless expansions to monitor additional conditions—such as stroke risk, heart arrhythmias, sleep apnea, fall detection, panic attacks, Parkinson's disease, and athlete performance—using the same hardware platform. This modular extensibility positions NeuroGuard as a versatile, future-proof solution for remote patient monitoring, reducing reliance on costly inpatient EEG systems.

**Key Impact Metrics (Targeted)**:
- **Scalability**: Supports 10,000+ users with cloud auto-scaling.
- **Reliability**: Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) >1,000 hours.
- **Performance**: Data processing latency <1 second.
- **Security**: End-to-end encryption and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## Problem Statement

Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, with seizures posing life-threatening risks due to unpredictable onset. Traditional monitoring relies on cumbersome EEG equipment in clinical settings, limiting continuous, ambulatory use. Caregivers and providers lack real-time, actionable insights, leading to delayed responses and suboptimal outcomes. NeuroGuard addresses these gaps by democratizing predictive analytics through wearable IoT, AI/ML, and seamless multi-channel alerting.

## Solution Overview

NeuroGuard integrates hardware sensors (e.g., BioAmp for EEG/EMG, MAX30102 for HR/SpO2, MPU6050 for motion) with edge processing on ESP32 for low-latency anomaly detection. Cloud-based AI (via Firebase) handles advanced time-series analysis for seizure forecasting. The system ensures offline resilience with local buffering and SIM800L-enabled emergency communications.

### Core Features
- **Predictive Monitoring**: AI/ML models (e.g., LSTM/CNN) forecast seizures using neural and physiological signals.
- **Multi-Modal Alerts**: Immediate notifications via app push, dashboard, device haptics/audio, or escalated SMS/calls (if no response in 2 minutes).
- **User-Centric Interfaces**: Cross-platform Flutter app for patients/caregivers; web dashboard for clinicians.
- **Data Insights**: Anonymized, consent-based analytics for research partnerships; exportable reports (PDF/CSV/Excel).
- **Extensibility**: Plug-and-play modules for new conditions without hardware redesign.
